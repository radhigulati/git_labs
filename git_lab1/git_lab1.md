## *Make sure you complete the [pre-work](https://github.com/radhigulati/prework_instructions/blob/master/instructions.md) before continuing with the Git tutorial*

## Introduction 
In this tutorial you will learn how to:
* Use the command line
* Create and manipulate directories and files
* Commit and push changes to GitHub from the command line
* Create and accept pull requests

Knowing how to use a version control system and the command line are  considered basic requirements for software developers. After this tutorial, you will have some comfortability with the command line, using Terminal commands, Git, and GitHub.

During the tutorial you will be typing commands into the Terminal. The commands will appear like ```command``` or like 

    $ command
When I tell you to type a command into your terminal, type the command the way it is written. If you see a command with the ```$``` symbol, do not type the ```$``` symbol. The ```$``` symbol just shows you where you begin typing in the terminal. 

Glossary of Terminal commands:
* ```pwd```: present working directory
* ```ls```: list
* ```ls -la```: list all contents of directory including ignored files in long format
* ```cd```: change directory
* ```mkdir```: make directory
* ```touch```: creates a new file

<span style="color:red"> **TASK:** </span> Open up your terminal, and type the following commands:

* Type ```pwd``` to check what directory you are in. For example, I am in my ```git_tutorial``` directory and this is what I see ```/Users/radhika/projects/git_tutorial```.

* Type ```ls``` to list the contents in the current directory. 

* Type ```ls -la``` to list the contents in the current directory including ignored files.
